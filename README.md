# KeyStrips

Why has no one done this before?

The KeyStrip design allows for :

- A hybrid between handwired and pcb
- Modularity
- RGB
- Very very low cost since you don't buy 3 pcb's you don't need and no space is wasted
- Making custom ergo keyboards sooo incredibly easy 

Why would you make one custom if there are already so many out there? Because : some people have weird hands and specific additional features such as specific placements for particular modules.
